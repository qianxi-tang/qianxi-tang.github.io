# About Me

<img src="https://qianxi-tang.github.io/images/MeC112.jpg" class="floatpic" alt="Me" style="width:500px; height:auto; margin:0 0 1rem 1.25rem;">


Here is **Qianxi Tang (汤仟禧)**.<br>

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Applied Electronic Engineering at the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), advised by [Prof. Li Peng](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085451285). My work focuses on inverter technology for modern low-inertia power systems—grid-forming control, sliding-mode methods, and stability/resilience of inverter-dominated grids.

Before HUST, I earned a B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering and its Automation (Rail Traction Electrification) from Beijing Jiaotong University, where my thesis on cooperative multi-agent systems received the Outstanding Undergraduate Thesis award.

If you're interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out at —  **qianxi [at] hust.edu.cn**. I am looking for a postdoctoral position.
