## Major Projects

- **Synchronization for Renewable-Energy–Based Inverters (Contraction & GCFI)**<br>

</div>
  2025– · Large-scale synchronization & power sharing of inverters · Nonlinear theory (GFM/GCFI)<br>
  We design unified droop/VOC/SMC behaviors under a single contraction metric. The method yields *exponential* convergence of phases and voltages, proportional power sharing without a slack bus, and fast non-oscillatory current limiting during faults/large disturbances—robust to parameter spread and changing network R/X and SCR.<br>
  -**Focus:** metric synthesis; DC–AC coupled modeling; distributed sharing laws<br>
  **Tools:** MATLAB/Simulink, PLECS/EMT, Python (CVX/YALMIP)<br>

- **450 V ↔ 3 V Bidirectional Isolated DC-DC**<br>

  2024–2025 · The 4th Sungrow University Innovation Contest<br>
  2.5–3.65 V (low side) ↔ 430–530 V (high side); 550 W full-load; validated with non-resistive loads.<br>
  Developed a high-ratio, bidirectional isolated converter with precise voltage regulation and efficient power-flow control for charge/discharge; thermal design and layout co-optimized across wide input ranges.<br>
  **Focus:** modulation & current control; magnetics selection; thermal constraints<br>
  **Tools:** MATLAB/Simulink, PLECS, Altium Designer, FloTHERM XT<br>

- **Ultra-High-Efficiency Grid-Connected Power Conversion**<br>

  2023–2024 · Module-integrated converter<br>
  Full-bridge (primary) + Cycloconverter (secondary); independent C<sub>dc</sub> control; soft-switching (all devices); four-quadrant operation.<br>
  Designed and validated a high-efficiency AC interface enabling decoupled capacitor-voltage regulation, low switching loss, and seamless P/Q flow in all four quadrants; stable under weak SCR.<br>
  **Focus:** topology, control strategy, loss breakdown, EMT verification<br>
  **Tools:** MATLAB/Simulink, LTspice, Altium Designer<br>
